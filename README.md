# GraphML-export
MetaEdit+ generators producing GraphML file

Generators exports graph hierarchy made with domain-specific languages from MetaEdit+ to GraphML: generators cover ports and subgraphs.

.rep files include MERL generators for MetaEdit+ (www.metacase.com) that can be read into Generator Editor (see https://metacase.com/support/55/manuals/mwb/Mw-5_3_1.html#Heading1542). These can be imported to your language definition (Graph type) or to the main Graph enabling export to all languages. Genenerators can be freely changed in Generator Editor to detail them fitting to your language (e.g. exclude elements, move some items to edges instead of been nodes, or apply non-directed edges).

MetaEdit+ is a language workbench that allows supporting your modeling language. Tool provides functionality for collaborative modeling, versioning, model checking and publishing goal structures, available at: https://www.metacase.com/download.
